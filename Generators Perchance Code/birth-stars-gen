pageDescription
  This generator isn't fully accurate. In essence, it tries to figure out what your birth month, week and day would be if you had been born on the same day, in the Undergrowth AU.
  For one, the days are off. Yongasabi's five-day week is not compatible with the Gregorian calendar's seven-day. Since the Yongasabi months always start on a takiyuni, we can count up from there and assign days to each date in the month, 1st through to 30th.
  Obviously IRL the days aren't synced to the date at all, so anyone can be born on any day with any date. But since Saturday and Sunday don't exist, and thus don't have fortunes, being able to directly select the day you were born on would break the generator. So it may give you a Monday when you were born on a Thursday, etc.
  Also, the 31st doesn't exist. When counting with the 5-day system, it lands on a takiyuni, but when counting with a 7-day system, it lands on a muyoyuni. This generator randomly chooses between the two. Again, not accurate, but it guarantees you get a fortune.

But the month and week will be accurate, since those are synced to IRL months & moon phases.
