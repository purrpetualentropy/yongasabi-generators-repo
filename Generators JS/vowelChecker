// technically this function is unused and untested
// but uh, it should work? lol
// now i just need to write the function that'll call it ...

function vowelChecker (word) {
let finalChar = word.slice(-1)
let hFinalChar = word.slice(-2)
if (finalChar = "a" || "o" || "i" || "u" || "e") {return true} else if (hFinalChar = "ah" || "oh" || "ih" || "uh" || "eh") {return true} else {return false}
}

// that if statement includes every vowel
// since only the last letter of a word is grabbed
// ei becomes i, and is subsumed into i itself
// ae becomes e, and gets its own entry
// ending in H after any vowel is also considered a vowel bc of how the sounds interact
