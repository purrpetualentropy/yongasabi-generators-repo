// technically this function is unused and untested
// but uh, it should work? lol
// now i just need to write the function that'll call it ...

function vowelChecker (word) {
let finalChar = word.slice(-1)
if (finalChar = "a" || "o" || "i" || "u" || "e") {return true} else {return false}
}

// that if statement includes every vowel
// since only the last letter of a word is grabbed
// ei becomes i, and is subsumed into i itself
// ae becomes e, and gets its own entry
