0 - descriptive angsa
1 - possessive angsa
2 - locative angsa
3 - VOM
4 - hanta, kata, satka
    maka should be split from this
    possibly kata is both hanta and maka type?
    but then "cutting the soup"
    yeah kata may need to be its own thing
4.1 - maka
    we're allowed to use decimals like this because our verbTypes will be a long list in perchance
    so we can just code it like that
4.2 - aktodaka
    i think the way the dict will end up shaking out is that each whole number covers a particular "topic"
    you can see the similarities between hanta and aktodaka, and aktodaka and kata
    and ultimately the goal of much of those things is to eat, or get food
    so yeah. use whole numbers to indicate "relation". that way we can still split as we need
    without making things extremely confusing and having maka be verbType 8 and yahla verbType 19 or something
5 - kapa
6 - asa
    regarding 4, 5, and 6, we may need to split them into "slugcat" and "non-slugcat", for lack of a better word
    gila hantasa shouldnt take the same dirbojs as yongasabi hantasa
    i wonder if that's a useful case for decimals
    but we should think lots more on this before we do any form of splitting
7 - jamya, kadma
8 - nana
9 - aba
10 - paha
