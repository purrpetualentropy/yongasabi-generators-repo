I only have this repo so that I can access the code on my computer and laptop without needing to send it to myself.

[Yongasabi](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZV2i_2E55lWS5N-sz8st-FFfAmZ_rSYHeU5yJxaubY8/) is a constructed language made by Pashoo. 'Constructed language' means that it was a language created and developed by a person, or multiple people in collaboration, rather than evolving over many generations of speakers. Conlangs often have unique purposes or linguistics.
In particular, Yongasabi is made for the universe of the video game Rain World.

The files in this repo pertain to multiple learning tools I am developing, in particular tools to create semi-random, grammatically and syntactically sound sentences in Yongasabi for people to practise their knowledge.
