<p>This page hosts links to all of my Yongasabi generators. It does nothing on its own.</p>
<p>You can use the arrows next to the headers to show all of the generators under that heading, as well as their descriptions.</p>
<p>A generator marked with the warning emoji, ⚠️, has some issues. These will not be issues that break the generator.</p>

<a href="https://perchance.org/yongasabi-sentence-arguments">Yongasabi Sentence Arguments Generator</a><br>(Eventually) will generate various sentence arguments (subject, object, indirectobejct, etc) as well as modifiers (like adjectives and averbs, verb voices or tenses, focus constructions) and extra challenges (like creating a conversation with the sentence as a starting point).<br><br> It will not use these things to create a sentence: instead, it tells you to make a sentense using them.
